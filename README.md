stbl
====

A folk of Mark Veillette's MATLAB library for working with alpha stable distributions

Changelog from the original:
* Placed all the functions in `+stbl` package and stripped `stbl` from their file names for ease of use.
* Updated `quadv` calls to `integral` with `'ArrayValued'` option set.
* Added m-files of Mark's examples.
