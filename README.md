stbl
====

A folk of Mark Veillette's MATLAB library for working with alpha stable distributions

Changelog from the original:
* Placed all the functions in `+stbl` package and stripped `stbl` from their file names for ease of use.
* Changed `quadv` calls to `integral`

For documentation, see Mark's website: http://math.bu.edu/people/mveillet/html/alphastablepub.html.
